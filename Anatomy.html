		<h3> Anatomy of a Rifle </h3>
		<p> The back of the rifle is called the butt, theres a few tosses you do from the butt</p>
		<p> The strap on the underside is called the strap, theres a few tricks and tosses you do from the strap </p>
		<p> The bolt is the silver (or black) part in the middle and from what I know theres not a lot of tosses from that part of the rifle </p>
		<p> The rivet between the bolt and the butt is called the neck, you do some tosses while holding from here </p>
		<p> The long part at the front is the nose, you do some maneuvers with nose and you also hold the nose for some tosses </p>
		
		<br>
		<p class="overall"> Overall, rifle seems to be more toss focused than a lot of equipments, being clunkier than saber but smaller and less eye catching than flag you need real explosive power to be eye catching </p>

		<h3> Anatomy of a Sabre </h3>
		<p> The handle of the sabre is know as the hilt (or the handle)</p>
		<p> The front of the hilt is your guard this is where you do most of your tosses(I don't do sabre) </p>
		<p> The blade of the sabre is called (you guessed it) the blade, you toss from the blade a lot too </p>
		<p> The top of the blade is the tip, I don't really know of anything you'd do from here </p>
			<br>
		<p class="overall"> Overall, sabre is way more of moving your body and dance than other equipments but don't get it twisted this thing flies when tossed </p>

		<h3> Anatomy of a Flag </h3>
		<p> The top of the pole is called is the tip </p>
		<p> The area where the silk connects to the flag is called the sleeve </p>
		<p> The pieces of tape throughout the pole are your 'cheaters' or just your tapes </p>
		<p> Theres two tapes under the sleeve </p>
		<p> the bottom of your pole is called the crutch tip </p>
		<br>
		<p class="overall"> While flag is still about body movement I find that it hindges on tosses a lot more than some of your other equipments </p>
