		<h3> Winter Guard </h3>
		<p> Winter Guard is, Color Guard... in the winter (Duh). In Winter Guard you're probably preforming in gyms instead of on football fields. I find that winter guard has a lot more focus on your body, with the ability to move on your tarp without ruining your uniform. Also more equipment like sabre is used a lot more in winter due to the fact that you don't have to take strong winds into account. Most of the time winter guard is split up into JV and Varsity like a lot of other sports. I find that winterguard is an amazing chance to get to know your guard more than marching band but also sometimes its not as fun, with less competitions (if you're in JV).</p>

		<h3> Marching band / Fall Guard </h3>
		<p> In the fall you get the chance to do color guard for the Marching Band. Fall guard is really fun, with football games and competitions once you get to october you can say good bye to your freetime and hello to back-to-back weekend preformances. While it may sound overwhelming, Marching Band is an amazing chance to refine your ability to memorize, count and get familiar with some of your flag skills. In Marching Band I saw a lot more of a focus on my equipment rather than my body, now that doesn't mean you can just move your body however you want, you still need to keep your shoulders boxed out and march correctly, fall still has emphasis on your body work but just not as much as winter guard. I think both types of guard really set you up for the other type. </p>
