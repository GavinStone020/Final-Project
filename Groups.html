		<h3> Juxtaposition </h3>
		<p> Juxta is an indepenent Ohio based Color Guard group. Juxtaposition have <a href="https://juxtawg.org/">this neat website</a> of their own. I saw their "Architecture. Breathing. Life." show and it was stunning and eye catching. If you ever get the chance to see their preformances you should take it, they all are amazing at what they do.</p> 		<iframe id="media_player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N8tLH4xjSe8?si=e9UJe7a8WmfqTYbm"  width="608" height="402" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozAllowFullScreen allow="autoplay *; fullscreen *; encrypted-media *" frameborder="0" title="Media Player"></iframe>

		<h3> Loveland Highschool Marching Band, Ohio </h3>
		<p>Loveland is where I go! I have done Color Guard for my school for two years now. Color Guard has genuinely changed my life so much and thats in no short thanks to the people in it. Last year's theme was "Smooth Criminal" and one of our judges called it "A Hypercharged Bank Heist". This show had some good songs like, Gangsta's Paradise by Coolio, Dead Or alive by Bon Jovi and obviously, Smooth Criminal by MJ himself. Smooth Criminal was my first show but, this years show "Animal Crackers" sounds just as fun, its a circus show but besides that we don't know anything else about it! (As of may 2025). Our JV winterguard group was also just as stellar as our marching band, last year's show was Welcome to New York by Taylor Swift and this year it was Cosmic Love. Here's our <a href="https://www.instagram.com/loveland.colorguard/"> Instagram page! </a></p>
